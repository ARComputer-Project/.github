## ARC — Autonomous (Anarchist's) Radio Computer, project which aims to create a cheap and open-source cellphone-like device.
ARC concept can be described as a smartphone + Flipper Zero + devboard + LoRa MESH node with Internet-over-RF capability.
The main goals are:
1) To create the network for free communications, without ISPs, censorship and spyware.
2) To create fully DIY opensource pocket computer/phone, which would be either minimalistic or functional depending on setup.
